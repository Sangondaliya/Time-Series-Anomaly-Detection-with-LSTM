# Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection-with-LSTM
### Timeseries anomaly detection using LSTM based on Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) 

### Problem Definition
Define the objective of anomaly detection within the context of Johnson & Johnson stock price data. The goal is to identify abnormal patterns that could indicate potential market-changing events or irregularities.

### Business Impact
Understand the significance of accurate anomaly detection. Timely identification of anomalies can help mitigate risks, inform investment strategies, and ensure regulatory compliance.

### Data Collection

Gather historical stock price data for Johnson & Johnson. Include relevant variables, such as date, closing price, trading volume, and potentially external factors like market indices and news sentiment.

### Anomaly Definition
Define what constitutes an anomaly for Johnson & Johnson stock price data. Anomalies could be sudden price spikes, drops, or unusual volatility.

### Time Series Decomposition
Analyze the time series data to decompose it into components like trend, seasonality, and residual. Understanding these components can aid in anomaly detection.
